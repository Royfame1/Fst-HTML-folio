<h1>The Best Movies According to Roland</h1>
<h2>My Top Four (3) Movies of All Time</h2> <hr />
<h3>Legend of The Seeker</h3>
<p>This is a very interesting Adventurous mobie with magical work at its peak
</p>
<h3>State Of Emergency</h3>
<p>This is a Nigerian Home movie with a lot of suspends. Betrayal, Patriotism, and sacrifice can be link to the theme</p>
<h3>The Senator</h3>
<p>From his High School days, he dreamt of being a senator. Very intelligent and humble 
    yet he won't let anyone stand on his way of becoming a senator. He deployed both the ugly and fair means of becoming one.</p>
